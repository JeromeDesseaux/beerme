**LEARNING PURPOSES PROJECT**

# What's this project about ?

React's hooks are game breakers. This project is a simple one made to test them out commiting state changes on simple get requests using axios and manipulating data through a simple form. Why beers ? Why not. I like beers. Don't you ? 

# Setup 

Clone this repo, then execute `yarn install` then `yarn start` and let the magic happen.
